4. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license

### Step 3: Update Remote and Push

Update the remote to point to your new repository:

```bash
# Remove the original remote
git remote remove origin

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/anvara-takehome-[yourname].git

# Push all branches and history
git push -u origin main
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: Repository is Private

**Solution:** Go to Settings → Danger Zone → Change visibility → Make public

### Issue: Forgot to Push Changes

**Solution:**

```bash
git status  # Check uncommitted changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push
```

### Issue: Can't Push to Repository

**Solution:**

```bash
# Verify remote URL
git remote -v

# Should show YOUR repository, not the original
# If not, repeat Step 3 above
```

### Issue: TypeCheck Fails

**Solution:** This is expected initially! Challenge 1 is to fix these errors. Make sure you've completed all challenges before submitting.

---

## Time Expectations

- Work at your own pace - there's no time limit
- Submit when you feel you've shown your best work
- Where you stop helps us understand your current skill level
- Quality matters more than quantity

Some candidates complete 2-3 challenges, others finish all 5 plus bonuses. Both are valuable outcomes!

---

## What Happens Next?

After you submit:

1. **We'll clone your repository** and review your code
2. **We'll run the setup** to verify everything works
3. **We'll review your commits** to understand your approach
4. **We'll test your implementation** in the browser
5. **We'll provide feedback** asap

---

## Tips for Success

### 🎯 Complete What You Can

Work through the challenges in order (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5) and complete as many as you can. Each challenge builds on previous ones and helps us evaluate different skill areas.

**Don't stress about finishing everything!** Where you stop is meaningful data for us:

- Stopping after Challenge 2-3? That's okay - we can see your frontend and TypeScript skills
- Made it to Challenge 4-5? Great - you've shown full-stack capabilities
- Finished everything? Awesome - tackle the bonus challenges!

The goal is to see your best work, not to race through everything.

### 💾 Commit Frequently

Make small, focused commits as you work through each challenge. This helps us understand your problem-solving process.

### 📝 Write Clear Commit Messages

Follow the pattern: `Type: Brief description`

- **Fix**: Bug fixes
- **Add**: New features
- **Refactor**: Code improvements
- **Docs**: Documentation changes
- **Test**: Adding tests

### 🧪 Test Your Work

Before submitting:

- Test in the browser with both demo accounts
- Verify all CRUD operations work
- Check the console for errors
- Run the type checker and linter

### 🚫 Don't Commit Sensitive Data

The `.env` file should NOT be committed. Make sure it's in `.gitignore`.

### 💬 Add Notes

If you made interesting decisions or want to highlight something, add a note in your submission email or update the README.
